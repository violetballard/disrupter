# Armor
Armor is tracked using only three Stats: Armor (A, %), Wounds (W, #), and Movement (M, #) (See [Rule 6][rule6], [Rule 7][rule7] [Rule14][rule14] and [Rule 16 - Firing][rule16]).

Please pay attention to the formatting of these tables if you are submitting a new piece of Armor. We suggest writing them without the block quotes and then adding them when you are complete. At least for our preferred VS Code Markdown Table plugin, our table tab-completion does not like the blockquotes. However, the blockquotes make these tables legible.

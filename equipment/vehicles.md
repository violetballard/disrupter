# **Vehicles**
Vehicles use a set of Stats (See [Rule 6][rule6]) very similar to that of [Armor][armor] with a few additions.
- Armor (A, %)
- Movement (M, #)
- Crew (C, #)
- Capacity (Cap, #) - Number of Infantry that can be held as passengers
- Weapon Slots - Number of Weapons that can be mounted on the Vehicle, Vehicle Weapons are listed in their own section of the [Weapon Specifications][weapons].

[weapons]: ./weapons.md
[armor]: ./armor.md
[rule6]: /rules/core/main.md#rule6

Vehicles themselves are not that exciting, the Weapons attached to them provide more of the flavor. However, the description text does allow for individual Vehicles to cause interesting wrinkles on the battlefield.

Please pay attention to the formatting of these tables if you are submitting a new Vehicle. We suggest writing them without the block quotes and then adding them when you are complete. At least for our preferred VS Code Markdown Table plugin, our table tab-completion does not like the blockquotes. However, the blockquotes make these tables legible.

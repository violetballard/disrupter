# Bots
Bots share the same stats as [Armor](armor.md), Armor (A, %), Wounds (W, #), and Movement (M, #) (See [Rule 6][rule6], [Rule 7][rule7], [Rule 9 - Classes][rule9], [Rule 14][rule14], and [Rule 16 - Firing][rule16]).

Please pay attention to the formatting of these tables if you are submitting a new Bot. We suggest writing them without the block quotes and then adding them when you are complete. At least for our preferred VS Code Markdown Table plugin, our table tab-completion does not like the blockquotes. However, the blockquotes make these tables legible.

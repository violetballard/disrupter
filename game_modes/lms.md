# **Last Man Standing**
Due to the chain of command, Last Man Standing mode is not a simple deathmatch skirmish. There is no need to incapicitate or kill every single one of your opponent's Units, the focus is on taking out Officers.

## **Objective**
Become the only remaining force on the Board by incapcitating or killing every enemy Officer, forcing your opponent to surrender.

## **Set Up**
Forces should start on opposite edges or corners of the board depending on your selected Board.

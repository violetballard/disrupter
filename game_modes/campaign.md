# **Campaign**
For Disrupter, a campaign is defined as a series of games played amongst the same players. The simplest option is to declare a winning number of games and to play your campaign until someone has won that many games.

## **Reserves**
You can give each side a Reserve force with the same number of Units as their Platoon.

Whenever a Unit is removed from the Board, roll a d100. If you roll under 50, the Unit is incapacitated, and if you roll 50 or more, the unit is dead. In between matches, a Platoon may replenish dead Units with Units from the Reserve force. Incapcitated Units are able to return to fight in the next game.

Play games in your campaign until one side's forces are eliminated or a side surrenders.

## **Debt**
A Debt economy will be developed in a future release (See [TODO][todo]). This will allow each Force to be more customized and provides a method for upgrading Platoons over time.

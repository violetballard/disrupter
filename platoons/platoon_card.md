# **Platoon Card**
I'm still unsure on the format for this. I'm gonna write my draft in Markdown for a subsequent version (See [TODO][todo]). If someone wants to create a fillable pdf of the card I develop, it can go in the resources folder.

For now, you're on your own for tracking your Platoons. Maybe someone else will develop something before I do?

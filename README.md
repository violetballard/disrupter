# Disrupter
## *Version 0.1*

Disrupter is a set of rules for 10mm miniatures wargaming. It is platoon scale and infantry focused.

Disrupter is inspired by the NSR movement in ttrpgs. It is seeking to be an NSR equivalent to the Game Designers' Workshop game Striker. If you want to play Striker, it is well-written and still available, this is not an attempt at a direct clone. It is more inspired by the approach of a game like Shovel Knight by Yacht Club Games that gives players an enjoyable modern experience that elicits the same feeling as older games. It is also highly influenced by the 0e version of the Panic Engine used in Mothership by Tuesday Knight Games, Dropzone Commander by TTCombat, and CAV: Strike Operations by Talon Games.

Striker focuses on operations up to a company level. Disrupter takes this down one level of scale to a platoon level. Dropzone Commander is at the platoon level, but it has a larger focus on vehicles than Disrupter. Version 0.1 focuses exclusively on infantry and one infantry-like vehicle (inflatable transport boat). Eventually, we want the game to develop infantry scale vehicle rules (atvs, jeeps, apcs, trucks, small numbers of small tanks, etc.) influenced by Gaslands. The goal is to eventually create a tabletop game that resembles the early prototypes of Halo as a tactics game like the games in the Myth franchise. This includes a focus on a small number of weapons and vehicles with vehicles that are super fun to manuever.

            - Tech level equivalent to Starship Troopers by Robert Heinlein
                - Yes, the book is fascist. Fuck fascism, the tech is interesting, though. Heinlein would hate that a Leftist non-binary trans woman is appropriating things from his book, so I'm good with it. The politics of this game are more closely aligned with Starship Troopers by Paul Verhoeven, and the neoliberal corporate horror of Mothership.

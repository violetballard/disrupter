# Disrupter
## *Version 0.1*

Disrupter is an open source set of rules for 10mm miniatures wargaming. It is platoon scale and infantry focused. Players take the role of a squad of veteran freelance mercenaries in the future. They have automated their forces, so half of their platoon consists of sophisticated, semi-autonomous battlefield robots.

Disrupter is inspired by the NSR movement in ttrpgs. It is seeking to be an NSR equivalent to the Game Designers' Workshop game Striker. If you want to play Striker, it is well-written and still available, this is not an attempt at a direct clone. It is more inspired by the approach of a game like Shovel Knight by Yacht Club Games that gives players an enjoyable modern experience that elicits the same feeling as older games. It is also highly influenced by the 0e version of the Panic Engine used in Mothership by Tuesday Knight Games, Dropzone Commander by TTCombat, and CAV: Strike Operations by Talon Games.

Striker focuses on operations all the way up to a company level. Disrupter focuses only on the platoon level. Striker has the technology levels and equipment to support everything from WWI to the future with a full gamut of vehicles. Striker includes sophisticated design sequences allowing you to create any weapon or vehicle that you could want. Disrupter is much more purposeful and tries to replicate the command and turn structure of Striker while providing a much more focused set of Armor, Weapons, Bots, and, eventually, vehicles.

Dropzone Commander is at the platoon level, but it has a larger focus on vehicles than Disrupter. Version 0.1 of Disrupter focuses exclusively on infantry and one infantry-like vehicle (inflatable transport boat).

Eventually, we want the game to develop infantry scale vehicle rules (atvs, jeeps, apcs, trucks, small numbers of small tanks, etc.) influenced by Gaslands. The goal is to eventually create a tabletop game that resembles the early prototypes of Halo as a tactics game like the games in the Myth franchise. This includes a focus on a small number of weapons and vehicles that are super fun to manuever.

The Create Commons Attribution license was chosen because we want people to be able to take these rules and run with them. However, we are not running a licensing department and provide no support. RV Games does want to make these rules into a published product at some point in time, and we plan to keep the Disrupter rules free and open source on github in perpetuity.

We give fair warning that the license does allow for commercial use, and RV Games or someone else can produce products using these rules that make money.

            - Tech level equivalent to Starship Troopers by Robert Heinlein
                - Yes, the book is fascist. Fuck fascism, the tech is interesting, though. Heinlein would hate that a Leftist non-binary trans woman is appropriating things from his book, so I'm good with it. The politics of this game are more closely aligned with Starship Troopers by Paul Verhoeven, and the neoliberal corporate horror of Mothership.

        - More fully featured bots suitable for higher damage level weapons
        - Robots who can give orders to other robots
            - Robots are programmed to always be subservient to humans, cannot give orders to them

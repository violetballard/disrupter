# **Rules**
## <a name="setup"></a> **Set Up**
### <a name="rule1"></a> **Rule 1 - Number of Players**
Disrupter is currently designed for two-sided battles. Rules for having three or more platoons facing each other will probably come later with the addition of further game modes. However, each side can be cooperative and asymmetrical. It is best suited to cames that are 1v1 all the way up to games that are 3v3. When multiple players are on the same side, they play cooperatively with each player taking on the role of an officer within their platoon (see Rule #). It is possible to play the game solo as well, you just have to control the opposing force, there are no special solo rules at the moment. Having someone who knows the rules well play as a referee can definitely make gameplay smoother, but a referee is not a requirement.

1v2+ (up to 5) games take on the vibe of a ttrpg with one player operating as referee to provide a co-operative experience for the other players at the table. See the Campaign game mode for more ideas about how to play this way.

### <a name="rule2"></a> **Rule 2 - Board**
Disrupter is designed for 24"x24" or 36"x36" boards containing approximately 50% Terrain.
- Buildings
- Soft Cover
    - Forest, Jungle, Undergrowth, Barricades, Unmanned Vehicles, etc.

You can build your own terrain if that's your thing, but we highly suggest using things you already have or using play surfaces from other games and from toys. We want you play, not worry about your crafting skills. For a city environment, we suggest using the tiles and buildings from a Dropzone Commander [City][cityscape]/[Ruinscape][ruinscape]. For a jungle environment, we recommend a [Children's Playset][playset]. There are plenty of digital maps available that you can adapt if you are wanting to play using a VTT.

We suggest drawing or overlaying a 50mm hex grid on top of the terrain (see [Rule 4](#rule4) and [Rule 5](#rule5)). This is very simple to do if you are playing using a VTT or with taped down transperency sheets (which also allow you to write on them with wet erase markers).

### <a name="rule3"></a> **Rule 3 - Dice**
Disrupter is a d100 roll under system (see Rule #), so it uses a subset of a full Mothership Dice Set.
- 8 differently colored d100 sets - Blue, Green, Yellow, Purple, Pink, Red, Black, and Ivory
    - The different colors help yout multiple rolls simultaneously
- 1 red d20 per player

### <a name="rule4"></a> **Rule 4 - Miniatures**
Disrupter is designed for use with 10mm miniatures. This is because of this scale's combination of affordability and model detail. They are really easy to paint, and we suggest spending as little time as possible painting your miniatures to get on the board. We suggest using white primer and solid color (red and blue) Speedpaint for human miniatures and black primer and metallic (gold and silver) applied via a dry brush (Slap Chop Method) for Bots (see Rule #).

However, we encourage you to re-use miniatures that you already have. It is easy to scale up and down the model size and measurements (see Rule #). You can use chits, coins, or even meeples. A standard meeple is at a 15mm scale.

#### <a name="rule4.basing"></a> *Basing*
We make some unorthodox suggestions about basing, but please use based models that you already have, use movement trays, or move individual units. Our suggestions for basing seek to make bookkeeping and measurement as simple as possible while playing.

Miniatures for infantry should be based four to a stand. You need some way to remove or mark (small rubber bands are recommended) units when they need to be removed from the board.

We suggest sticking [50mm flexible steel bases][flexible] onto [6mm thick black plastic 50mm hex bases][plastic]. We suggest drilling small holes in the individual unit bases and then gluing [small magnets (3mmx1mm)][magnets] into the hole. This way, you are able to remove units from a stand, and they stay in place more solidly than if using a movement tray.

You can choose a different shape if want to play using measurement instead of a hex grid (see Rule #). If you are playing using measurement, you can even use extra bases as measurement tools.

These 50mm hex bases allow you to play on a hex grid, or you can use extra bases as rulers if you are playing using measurement instead of a grid (see [Rule 5](#rule5)). The thick plastic base also allows you to label the bases with a code for their team and squad designation, making for easier tracking on your Platoon Card. A paint or white out marker or a label maker work best for this.

## <a name="rule5"></a> **Rule 5 - Measurement**
Movement and Range are indicated in hex measurements (see [Rule 4 - Basing](#rule4.basing)).

### <a name="rule.5.range"></a> **Range Bands**
| Close(C) | Medium(M) | Long(L) |
| :------: | :-------: | :-----: |
|    1     |     2     |    3    |
|          |           |         |

### <a name="rule.5.ruler"></a> **Ruler Distance**
You do not need to play on a hex grid (see [Rule 2]("rule2) and [Rule 4 - Basing](#rule4.basing)); it is possible to use ruler measurement as well. Measure from the same part of the stand to the same part of the stand (center to center, front to front, etc.) using the following conversion factor.

    1 Hex = 50mm = 2"

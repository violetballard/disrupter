# **Vehicle Rules**
When the Vehicle Rules are complete, Disrupter will contain an entirely separate set of Movement and LOS rules for Vehicles. The vision is for Infantry to be locked in hex based combat while the Vehicles wrecklessly move around them using Gaslands inspired Movement templates. This is what will give the game a very Halo feel.

The only Vehicle currently in the game is an [Inflatable Boat][inflatable], and it mostly operates like an Infantry Unit (See [Vehicle Specifications][vehicles]).

# **Rules**
## <a name="setup"></a> **Set Up**
### <a name="rule1"></a> **Rule 1 - Number of Players**
Disrupter is currently designed for two-sided battles. Rules for having three or more platoons facing each other will probably come later with the addition of further game modes. However, each side can be cooperative and asymmetrical. It is best suited to cames that are 1v1 all the way up to games that are 3v3. When multiple players are on the same side, they play cooperatively with each player taking on the role of an officer within their platoon (see [Rule 9](#rule9)). It is possible to play the game solo as well, you just have to control the opposing force, there are no special solo rules at the moment. Having someone who knows the rules well play as a referee can definitely make gameplay smoother, but a referee is not a requirement.

1v2+ (up to 5) games take on the vibe of a ttrpg with one player operating as referee to provide a co-operative experience for the other players at the table. See the Campaign game mode for more ideas about how to play this way.

### <a name="rule2"></a> **Rule 2 - Board**
Disrupter is designed for 24"x24" or 36"x36" boards containing approximately 50% Terrain. This is to ensure that games stay short and engaging unlike with a larger board.
- Buildings
- Soft Cover
    - Forest, Jungle, Undergrowth, Barricades, Unmanned Vehicles, etc.

You can build your own terrain if that's your thing, but we highly suggest using things you already have or using play surfaces from other games and from toys. We want you play, not worry about your crafting skills. For a city environment, we suggest using the tiles and buildings from a Dropzone Commander [City][cityscape]/[Ruinscape][ruinscape]. For a jungle environment, we recommend a [Children's Playset][playset]. There are plenty of digital maps available that you can adapt if you are wanting to play using a VTT.

We suggest drawing or overlaying a 50mm hex grid on top of the terrain (see [Rule 4](#rule4) and [Rule 5](#rule5)). This is very simple to do if you are playing using a VTT or with taped down transperency sheets (which also allow you to write on them with wet erase markers).

### <a name="rule3"></a> **Rule 3 - Dice**
Disrupter is a d100 roll under system (see [Rule 7](#rule7)), so it uses a subset of a full Mothership Dice Set.
- 8 differently colored d100 sets - Blue, Green, Yellow, Purple, Pink, Red, Black, and Ivory
    - The different colors help yout multiple rolls simultaneously
- 1 red d20 per player

### <a name="rule4"></a> **Rule 4 - Miniatures**
Disrupter is designed for use with 10mm miniatures. This is because of this scale's combination of affordability and model detail. They are really easy to paint, and we suggest spending as little time as possible painting your miniatures to get on the board. We suggest using white primer and solid color (red and blue) Speedpaint for human miniatures and black primer and metallic (gold and silver) applied via a dry brush (Slap Chop Method) for [Bots][bots].

However, we encourage you to re-use miniatures that you already have. It is easy to scale up and down the model size and measurements (see [Rule 5](#rule5)). You can use chits, coins, or even meeples. A standard meeple is at a 15mm scale. Get a Platoon on the board!

#### <a name="rule4.basing"></a> *Basing*
We make some unorthodox suggestions about basing, but please use based models that you already have, use movement trays, or move individual units. Our suggestions for basing seek to make bookkeeping and measurement as simple as possible while playing.

Miniatures for infantry should be based four to a stand. You need some way to remove or mark (small rubber bands are recommended) units when they need to be removed from the board.

We suggest sticking [50mm flexible steel bases][flexible] onto [6mm thick black plastic 50mm hex bases][plastic]. We suggest drilling small holes in the individual unit bases and then gluing [small magnets (3mmx1mm)][magnets] into the hole. This way, you are able to remove units from a stand, and they stay in place more solidly than if using a movement tray.

You can choose a different shape if want to play using measurement instead of a hex grid (see [Rule 5 - Ruler Distance](#rule5.ruler)). If you are playing using measurement, you can even use extra bases as measurement tools.

These 50mm hex bases allow you to play on a hex grid, or you can use extra bases as rulers if you are playing using measurement instead of a grid (see [Rule 5 - Ruler Distance](#rule5.ruler)). The thick plastic base also allows you to label the bases with a code for their team and squad designation, making for easier tracking on your Platoon Card. A paint or white out marker or a label maker work best for this.

## <a name="rule5"></a> **Rule 5 - Measurement**
Movement and Range are indicated in hex measurements (see [Rule 4 - Basing](#rule4.basing)).

### <a name="rule.5.range"></a> **Range Bands**
| Close (C) | Medium (M) | Long (L) |
| :------: | :-------: | :-----: |
|    1     |     2     |    3    |
|          |           |         |

### <a name="rule.5.ruler"></a> **Ruler Distance**
You do not need to play on a hex grid (see [Rule 2]("rule2) and [Rule 4 - Basing](#rule4.basing)); it is possible to use ruler measurement as well. Measure from the same part of the stand to the same part of the stand (center to center, front to front, etc.) using the following conversion factor. You can use this conversion factor to help you scale up or down your miniatures as well, depending on what you have available to you.

    1 Hex = 50mm = 2"

## <a name="rule6"></a> **Rule 6 - Stats**
All statistics are provided as a percentage likelihood of completing a risky action (See [Rule 7](#rule7)) unless stated otherwise.

| Stat (Abbreviation) | Description                                                                                                                    | Determined By |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| Instinct (I)        | Likelihood of making Battlefield Actions (See Rule #)                                                                          | Class         |
| Armor (A)           | Likelihood of taking damage from Fire (See Rule #)                                                                             | Equipment     |
| Wounds (W)          | Number of wounds taken before incapacitation or death (See Rule #)                                                             | Equipment     |
| Movement (M)        | Number of hexes that can be traversed during a Movement Action (See [Rule 5 - Ruler](#rule5.ruler) for Measurement Conversion) | Equipment     |
|                     |                                                                                                                                |               |

## <a name="rule7"></a> **Rule 7 - Checks and Saves**
Success and Failure in disrupter are determined entirely by d100 dice rolls (See [Rule 3](#rule3)). Rolling under a stat leads to success, rolling at or over a stat leads to failure.

You make an Instinct Check to attempt risky Battlefield Actions (See Rule #).
You make an Armor Save to attempt to avoid being Wounded (See Rule #).

A Critical Success or Critical Failure is rolled when the dice are doubles (11, 22, etc.).

Advantage [+] means to roll twice and take the most favorable result.

Disadvantage [-] means to roll twice and take the least favorable result.

Critical Successes and Critical Failures are always used even with [+] or [-].

## <a name="rule7"></a> **Rule 8 - Stress and Panic**
Stress is a counter with a maximum of 20 representing the stress levels for each platoon as a whole.

A Panic Check requires rolling over current Stress with a d20 (See [Rule 3](#rule3)) or the rolled effect occurs from the appropriate [Panic Table][panic] (Individual or Platoon).

- Gain 1 Stress during the Initiative Phase of each Game Turn (See Rule #)
- Gain 1 Stress for every Critical Failure
- Lose 1 Stress for every Critical Success
- Gain 1 Stress and make a Platoon Panic Check for every friendly human death
- Make an Individual Panic Check for each human unit within Close Range of a human death
- Bots do not Panic (See [Rule 9 - Classes](rule9.classes))

[panic]: ./panic.md

## <a name="rule9"></a> **Rule 9 - Chain of Command**
At its heart, Disrupter is a game about managing a chain of command.
- The Commanding Officer (CO) commands the entire Platoon. There is only one CO per Platoon.
- Non-Commisioned Officers (NCOs) command Squads.
    - Squads consist of 2-4 Teams, with each Team consisting of 1 Stand or Vehicle ([See Rule 4 - Basing](#rule4.basing)).
- Every unit within Close Range of an Officer receives [+] on all Checks and Saves (See [Rule 7](#rule7)).
- Officers must be a member of a Team or occupy a Vehicle, there are no individual infantry.
- An NCO may assume the role of CO if the CO is removed from the board.
- If all Officers for a Platoon are removed from the board that Platoon automatically Surrenders.
- See the [Blank Platoon Card][platoon] to better understand the structure of a Platoon.

[platoon]: /platoons/platoon_card.md

### <a name="rule9.classes"></a>**Classes**
There are three classes of units that enable the chain of command. All units are equipped with [Weapons][weapons] chosen by each Platoon during the Intelligence Briefing (See Rule #). Wounds (W) and Movement (M) are determined by equipped [Armor][armor] in the case of humans and model specifications for [bots][bots].

[bots]: /equipment/bots.md
[weapons]: /equipment/weapons.md
[armor]: /equipment/armor.md

- Officer, I:80

- Soldier, I:60

- Bot, I:40

### <a name="rule9.orders"></a>**Giving Orders**
Officers are able to give Orders to lower ranking officers (CO to NCO) and soldiers. Orders may be given over the radio. There is no range to radio, and you may assume that every unit has access to a helmet radio. Orders are short written statements recorded on a [Platoon Card][platoon]. Units follow their orders without deviation with small exceptions for Taking Cover (See Rule #), avoiding Fire (See Rule #), and returning with Reaction Fire (See Rule #) for self-defense.

Orders for NCOs should be broad enough to give them the autonomy to complete their outcomes. You are not giving turn-by-turn instructions. Orders for Soldiers should be more specific. 

### <a name="rule9.leading"></a>**Leading**
Officers and anyone they lead are able to freely use Movement Actions and Battlefield Actions (See Rule #). An Officer is able to lead any units that are within Close Range (See [Rule 5 - Range Bands](#rule5.range)). Bots are unable to follow orders and can only be led. Bots can only retreat and take cover and conduct Reaction Fire (See Rule #) for self-defense if they are not within Close Range of an officer.
